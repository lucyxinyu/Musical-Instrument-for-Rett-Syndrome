# Musical-Instrument-for-Rett-Syndrome

COVID-19 has dramatically impacted children living with Rett Syndrome. For example, there are forced lockdowns of rehabilitation centres, which disrupts their daily routines and relationships with nurses.
I decided to do something about their challenges by creating a musical instrument which will accomodate their needs.

This design was a part of the Dollarstore Challenge by Margaret Von Adamic-Vaight.
Budget Limit: $10

I documented my process from beginning to end via a 5 minute video recording.
